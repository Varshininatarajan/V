Hi
Yela unnav?

Em chepalo teliyadam ledu anduke idi rasanu 


Silence made sounds of waves and cold breeze
These made me think of a time when 
there is no place for silence
The hands which used to fit perfectly 
just like they are made for each other 
are now finding it difficult to hold on
The smile which I used to see now became a memory....
Every nicest thing that has ever happened 
can never be repeated and all I left with is those memories...
Everything is on the edge 
I don't know when things will fall apart 
and again I'll be left alone
